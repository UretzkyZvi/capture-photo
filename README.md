# Capture-Photo Component

The `capture-photo` component is part of a collection of reusable React components designed for direct integration into your applications without the need for installing external packages. This approach ensures that you can fully customize the component according to your project's requirements.

## Philosophy

This component follows the philosophy of not being a traditional component library. It is not available as an npm package. Instead, it is provided for you to copy directly into your project and modify as needed. This encourages a deeper understanding and customization of the components you use without abstracting the functionality into dependency packages.

## Features

- **Camera Integration**: Utilize the user's camera for photo capture functionalities.
- **Flexible UI**: Designed with a base style but easily customizable with CSS or styled components.
- **React and TypeScript**: Built using React and TypeScript to ensure type safety and component reusability.

## Folder Structure

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the relevant file structure for the `capture-photo` component:

```
/capture-photo
|-- /src
|   |-- /components
|   |   |-- /ui
|   |   |   |-- /camera
|   |   |   |   |-- camera-provider.tsx
|   |   |   |   |-- camera-types.ts
|   |   |   |   |-- camera-view.tsx
|   |   |   |   |-- camera.tsx
```

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Add Required shadcn-ui Components

Before integrating the `capture-photo` component, add the necessary UI components from shadcn-ui:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog
npx shadcn-ui@latest add scroll-area
```

### Step 2: Copy the Camera Component

Clone or download the component files into your project directory from the provided code repository, especially from `/src/components/ui/camera`.

 
### Step 3: Integration

Import and use the `CameraView` and other required components in your React application:

```jsx
import { CameraView } from './path/to/CameraView';
import { Button, Dialog } from './path/to/shadcn-ui-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CameraView />
      {/* Additional UI components */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Step 4: Customize as Needed

You can modify, style, and extend the components according to your UI and functionality requirements since they are now part of your codebase.

## Example Usage

This example demonstrates integrating the `Camera` component in an inventory management system to capture product images:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { CameraView } from './path/to/CameraView';
import { Dialog, DialogTrigger, DialogContent, Button } from './path/to/ui-components';
import { UploadIcon, CameraIcon } from '@heroicons/react/outline';

function Inventory() {
  const [showDialog, setShowDialog] = useState(false);
  const [capturedImages, setCapturedImages] = useState([]);

  return (
    <main className="flex flex-1 flex-col gap-4 p-4 lg:gap-6 lg:p-6">
      <div className="flex items-center">
        <h1 className="text-lg font-semibold md:text-2xl">Inventory</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-1 items-center justify-center rounded-lg border border-dashed shadow-sm">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center space-y-4 p-8">
          <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Add product image</h3>
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-4">
            {/* File upload and camera capture buttons */}
          </div>
          {/* Display captured images */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}

export default Inventory;
```
